# 🎨 Suvarna's Sketchbook

Welcome to my personal website! This project was designed to showcase my creative work in a unique, digital "Sketchbook" format. It moves away from standard templates to offer a custom, immersive experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Cinematic Splash Screen:** A custom video introduction that seamlessly fades into the main content, setting the artistic tone immediately.
* **Masonry "Pinterest-Style" Layout:** A dynamic CSS grid that automatically arranges vertical, horizontal, and square images into a cohesive collage without cropping or distortion.
* **Paper & Ink Theme:** A custom design aesthetic using blend modes (`mix-blend-mode: multiply`) to make digital assets look like they are drawn directly on textured paper.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * Active navigation highlighting (using Intersection Observer).
    * "Click to Copy" email feature for easy contact.
    * Personalized visitor counter (simulated with LocalStorage).
* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and video integration.
* **CSS3:** Advanced styling including Flexbox, CSS Grid (Masonry), Animation, and Variables.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Logic for the splash screen transition, clipboard functionality, and scroll tracking.
